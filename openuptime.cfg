# Server UUID — automatically assigned on installation, do not change this
OPENUPTIME_SERVER_UUID=""

# Reporting URL — the base URL of your OpenUptime platform API
OPENUPTIME_REPORTING_URL=""

# API Key — per-server secret token for authenticating metrics submissions
# DO NOT share this key with anyone

# Network Interfaces
# * if you leave this setting empty the agent will detect and monitor all of your active network interfaces
# * if you wish to monitor just one interface, fill its name down below (e.g., "en0")
# * if you wish to monitor just some specific interfaces, fill their names below separated by comma (e.g., "en0,en1")
NetworkInterfaces=""

# Check Services
# * separate service names by comma (,) with a maximum of 10 services to be monitored (e.g., "sshd,nginx,httpd,mysqld")
# * NOTE: this will only check if the service is running, not its functionality
CheckServices=""

# Check Software RAID Health
# * checks the status/health of any software RAID (AppleRAID) setup on the system
# * agent must be run as 'root' or privileged user to fetch the RAID status
# * 0 - OFF (default) | 1 - ON
CheckSoftRAID=0

# Check Drive Health
# * checks the health of any found drives on the system
# * requirements: 'smartmontools' (install via: brew install smartmontools)
# * agent must be run as 'root' or privileged user to use this function
# * 0 - OFF (default) | 1 - ON
CheckDriveHealth=0

# View Running Processes
# * whether or not to record the server's running processes and display them in your OpenUptime dashboard
# * 0 - OFF (default) | 1 - ON
RunningProcesses=0

# Port Connections
# * if left empty, the agent will auto-detect active listening ports on the system and track connections to them
# * if you wish to manually specify which ports to track, fill them down below separated by comma (e.g., "80,443,3306")
ConnectionPorts=""

# Custom Variables
# * path to a JSON file containing custom key-value pairs to include in metrics

# Secured Connection
# * if disabled, the agent will not check/verify the SSL integrity of the endpoint where it posts the collected metrics
# * 0 - OFF | 1 - ON (default)
SecuredConnection=1

# How frequently should data samples be collected
# * we don't recommend setting this value lower than 2 and higher than 10
# * increasing this value can help reduce the agent's resource usage on low-spec systems
# * the higher the value, the less accurate the metrics will be
CollectEveryXSeconds=3

# DEBUG Mode
# * if enabled, the agent will output debug information to the log file
# * 0 - OFF (default) | 1 - ON
# * WARNING: enabling this will generate a lot of log data, only enable this if you're having issues with the agent
DEBUG=0

# Outgoing PING
# * if enabled, the agent will perform outgoing PING tests towards the given targets (10 max)
# * format is: "TargetName1,TargetIP1|TargetName2,TargetIP2" example: "Google,8.8.8.8|Cloudflare,1.1.1.1"
# * allowed target name characters: alphanumerics, dots (.), dashes (-), underscores (_)
OutgoingPings=""

# Outgoing PING count
# * if OutgoingPings is enabled, this is the number of packets to send for each PING test
# * default is 20 | acceptable values are 10-40
